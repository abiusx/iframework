### The single-file lightweight PHP framework

iframework is the single-file light-weight PHP framework for quick applications. It is secure, provides easy session, user and database management and supports MVC. 

Basic useful feature list includes:

 * Session management
 * Secure user management
 * UserStore and Settings (per user and general settings with automatic expiration/timeout)
 * Database management and support (currently MySQL, SQLite, Postgres)
 * Open Source - Fully Editable
 * Builder Script - Transform the entire framework into a single file!
 * Supports MVC, and non-MVC architectures.
 * Basic sample pages included (e.g user management, login, sign-up, logout, etc.)
 * Automatic Header/Footer for pages
 * Automated installation

iframework is suitable for lightweight PHP applications that need a simple framework for basic needs, yet do not want the hassle of setting up a fat framework and corresponding database. It is easily extendable, allowing more complicated users and other structures, and supports header/footer templates so that quick websites can benefit from these templates.


A basic iframework application consists of three files in a folder: the .htaccess access control and validation file, start.php which is the entry point of the framework (plus configurations) and the iframework file.
